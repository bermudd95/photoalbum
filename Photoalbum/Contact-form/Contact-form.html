            <p>I want to first thank you for taking time to look at my project. One last thing I would like to ask from you is to let me know your thoughts. Feedback is one of the many things that helps me get better at what I do. Also, if you would like to see more of these projects or if you would like for me to do one of these for you, you can email me at <span>bermudd95@icloud.com</span></p>
